# Learning to rank
Investigated different approaches to the learning to rank:

1. Implemented an instance of the pointwise approach with linear regression based on
basic tf-idf features.

2. Implemented an instance of the pairwise approach, the ranking SVM method, using
basic tf-idf features.

3. Experimented with more features such as BM25 and PageRank.
